# CMPT732 Group Project - Analyses on New York Cab Data

In this project, we work on the trip data of yellow cabs and green cabs in New York from 2017 to 2021. Each group member choose their interested aspect to analyze, and the implemented codes can be found under each directory following the pattern _`aspect_eid`_. Please check the _running.md_ for a complete guide to test our implementation.

We also have a [_**project page**_](https://apphiawang.github.io/cmpt732_nyc_cab/) that demonstrated our project work in details, including data collection, methodology, analyses, and visualization.
